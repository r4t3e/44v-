<h1>Project Menacing Script - Grab Items, God Mode, More</h1>

Launched in 2020, the Roblox game *Project Menacing* has garnered nearly 8 million visits and regularly hosts up to 1,000 concurrent players. Inspired by the *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* anime, this action-packed mode drops players into a collaborative world where teamwork with a protective "Booth" entity is key to survival. The objective revolves around securing the ultimate "Stand"—a supernatural ability—and dominating opponents. To streamline this pursuit, a free script offers features like **Grab All Items**, **GodMode**, and dual **Invisible** modes for both players and their Stands, ensuring invincibility and a tactical edge. While immortality prevents users from being eliminated, the tools prioritize evasion and resource dominance, all accessible via the creators' website at no cost.
